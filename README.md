# cash-io

Keep track of money you earn and spend, with graphs and reports.

# What is it?

* Look at all the nice graphs.

# Banks supported

# Current state

cash-io is under irregular development and far from mature. It is foremost for
private use, and as an excuse for learning new tools (such as python's flask,
javascript, ajax, jquery, etc.)
